# PLUMBR

PLUMBR is a web application that allows users to manage plumbing parts and create jobs using those parts. It provides a user-friendly interface for adding parts to a database and creating new jobs that include specific parts from the database. Users can click on job icons to view detailed information about a specific job, and within the job detail view, they can click on parts to see detailed information about each part. A search bar is provided to search for jobs, and the search results are rendered in the detail view.
